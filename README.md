# LunchAndLearn
A place to put ideas on what'd you like to learn and participate in teaching a subject.

## What is Lunch and Learn?
Literally, lunch and learn is a day in which 1 person teaches a subject the whole room wants to learn. In more detail this repository was born out of the need of learning new things. A lunch and learn consists of 4 things:

1. Teacher
2. Student
3. Subject
4. Lunch

The `teacher` teaches a `subject` to the `students` that was picked by them. Also they eat `lunch`.

## So how does it work?
The entire `subject` database is stored in this repo, more specifically this README file. Under this heading you'll find the `subjects` that people would like to learn. To contribute to this list anyone can do a pull request adding your subject you'd like to learn to this list. If you want to this subject just add your name to the `teacher` column and the date you'd like to teach it. And vice-versa, if someone added a subject they would like to learn and you would like to teach it then put your name under the `teacher` column. Again, remembering this goes through pull requests.

I mean so far this is cool and all but it gets better! You don't need to know a `subject` to teach it. The `teacher` would need to learn that `subject` in order to teach the `students`. This is a perfect learning opportunity that will throw procrastination out the door. Let's start learning!
